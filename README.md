Implement the function func Calc(expression string) (float64, error) where expression is a string expression consisting of single-character identifiers and arithmetic operation symbols. The valid inputs include digits (rational numbers), operations +, -, *, /, and parentheses for prioritization ( and ). In case of an error in the expression syntax, the function should return an error.
